# UCSF VPN client (Linux)

The `ucsf-vpn` CLI command is a Linux-only tool for connecting to and disconnecting from the UCSF VPN server.  It is based on the official UCSF instructions provided by the [UCSF IT](https://it.ucsf.edu/services/vpn) with additional instructions obtained through private communication.

## Connect
```sh
$ ucsf-vpn start --user alice --pwd secrets --token prompt
Enter 'push', 'phone', 'sms', a 6 or 7 digit Duo token, or press your YubiKey: <valid token>
[sudo] password for alice: NNNNNNN
WARNING: Juniper Network Connect support is experimental.
It will probably be superseded by Junos Pulse support.
password#2:
OK: Successfully connected to the UCSF network [ip=128.218.43.191, hostname='', org='AS5653 University of California San Francisco']

$ ucsf-vpn status
Connected to the UCSF network [ip=128.218.43.53, hostname='',
org='AS5653 University of California San Francisco']

$ ucsf-vpn details
{
  "ip": "128.218.43.123",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "region": "California",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "37.7749,-122.4194",
  "org": "AS5653 University of California San Francisco",
  "postal": "94103",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}
```

If you have problems connecting to the VPN using `ucsf-vpn`, make sure you use the correct username and password by logging in via the [UCSF VPN web proxy].

Alternatively to command-line options, the username and password can also be specified in file `~/.netrc` (or the file that environment variable `NETRC` specifies).  See `ucsf-vpn --help` for more details.  With a properly setup `~/.netrc` entry, you can connect to the UCSF VPN using:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn start
[sudo] password for alice: NNNNNNN
WARNING: Juniper Network Connect support is experimental.
It will probably be superseded by Junos Pulse support.
password#2:
```
after approving the push notification on your Duo Mobile app (the default is `--token push`).



## Disconnect
```sh
$ ucsf-vpn stop
OK: Successfully disconnected from the UCSF network [ip=135.180.135.100, hostname='135-180-135-100.fiber.dynamic.sonic.net', org='AS46375 Sonic Telecom LLC']
```


## Usage

## Installation

### `ucsf-vpn`

The `ucsf-vpn` script is distributed under GPL (>= 2.1) and the source
code is available at https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/.  To
"install" it, just do

```
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/master/bin/ucsf-vpn
$ chmod ugo+x ucsf-vpn
```


## OpenConnect

In August 2017, the UCSF VPN server was updated such that it no longer works with OpenConnect (< 7.08).  Because of this, `uscf vpn` requires OpenConnect (>= 7.08).

OpenConnect (>= 7.08) is available on for instance Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), but not on older LTS version.  For instance, Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) only provides OpenConnect 7.06, which [fails to connect with an error](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/issues/4).  [There is a confirmed way to force install this](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/issues/4) on to Ubuntu 16.04 from the Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty) distribution, but it is not clear whether such an installation leaves the system in a stable state or not.  Moreover, due to library dependencies, it appears not possible to have OpenConnect 7.08 and Pulse Secure 5.3-3 installed at the same time.


## Pulse Secure Client

If you don't have OpenConnect (>= 7.08) you can use `ucsf vpn --method pulse` (or set environment variable `UCSF_VPN_METHOD=pulse`) to connect to the UCSF VPN using the Junos Pulse Secure client (Pulse Secure, LLC).  That software, which is a **closed-source proprietary software** (*), can be downloaded from UCSF website:

* https://software.ucsf.edu/content/vpn-virtual-private-network

Access to that page requires UCSF MyAccess Login (but no UCSF VPN).

Note: `ucsf-vpn --method pulse` is just a convenient wrapper script around the Pulse Secure client.  It is assumed that `pulsesvc` is available under `/usr/local/pulse/`. If not, set `PULSEPATH` to the folder where it is installed.


## Privacy

The `ucsf-vpn` software uses the https://ipinfo.io/ service to infer whether
a VPN connection is established or not, and to provide you with details on
your public internet connection.  The software does _not_ collect or attempt
to collect any of your UCSF credentials.
