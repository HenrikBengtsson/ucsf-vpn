# A UCSF VPN Client for Linux

The `ucsf-vpn` CLI command is a Linux-only tool for connecting to and disconnecting from the UCSF VPN server.  It is based on the official UCSF instructions provided by the [UCSF IT](https://it.ucsf.edu/services/vpn) with additional instructions obtained through private communication.

## Connect to the VPN

To connect to the UCSF VPN, call:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn start --user=alice --token=prompt
WARNING: This action ('ucsf-vpn start') requires administrative ("sudo") rights.
Enter the password for your account ('alice84') on your local computer ('alice-laptop'):
Enter your UCSF Active Directory password: <password>
Enter 'push' (default), 'phone', 'sms', a 6 or 7 digit Duo token, or press your YubiKey: <six-digit token>
OK: OpenConnect status: 'openconnect' process running (started 00h00m01s ago on 2024-06-25T09:05:20-07:00; PID=14549)
OK: IP routing tunnels: [n=1] tun0
OK: Public IP information (UCSF IT): public_ip=10.49.88.54, network='UCSF Network - Private Space'
OK: Flavor: default
OK: Connected to the VPN
```

If you have problems connecting to the VPN using `ucsf-vpn`, make sure you use the correct username and password by logging in via the [UCSF VPN web proxy].

Alternatively to command-line options, the username and password can also be specified in file `~/.netrc` (or the file that environment variable `NETRC` specifies).  See `ucsf-vpn --help` for more details.  With a properly setup `~/.netrc` entry, you can connect to the UCSF VPN using:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn start
NOTE: Open the Duo Mobile app on your smartphone or tablet to confirm ...
```
after approving the push notification on your Duo Mobile app (the default is `--token=push`).


## Disconnect from the VPN

To disconnect from the UCSF VPN, call:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn stop
OK: OpenConnect status: No 'openconnect' process running
OK: IP routing tunnels: none
OK: Public IP information (UCSF IT): public_ip=123.145.254.42, network='not UCSF'
OK: Not connected to the VPN
```


## Check status on VPN connection

To check whether you are connected to the UCSF VPN or not, call:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn status
OpenConnect status: 'openconnect' process running (started 08h31m27s ago on 2024-06-25T16:20:00-07:00; PID=17419)
IP routing tunnels: [n=1] tun0
OK: Public IP information (UCSF IT): public_ip=10.49.88.54, network='UCSF Network - Private Space'
Flavor: default
Connected to the VPN
```

To get full details of your current internet connection in JSON format, call:

```sh
$ ucsf-vpn details
{
  "ip": "10.49.88.54",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "region": "California",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "37.7749,-122.4194",
  "org": "AS5653 University of California San Francisco",
  "postal": "94103",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}
```


## Installation

The `ucsf-vpn` script is distributed under GPL (>= 2.1) and the source
code is available at https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/.  To
"install" it, just do

```
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenrikBengtsson/ucsf-vpn/master/bin/ucsf-vpn
$ chmod ugo+x ucsf-vpn
```



## Full command-line help
```
{{ HELP }}
```



## Required software

The `uscf-vpn` tool requires:

1. OpenConnect (>= 7.08)
2. Curl
3. Bash
4. Admin rights (sudo)


## Privacy

The `ucsf-vpn` software pings 9.9.9.9 (<https://www.quad9.net/>; a nonprofit
organization) to check whether there is a working internet connection or not.
Environment variable `UCSF_VPN_PING_SERVER` can be use to specify a different
ping server, e.g. `UCSF_VPN_PING_SERVER=www.ucsf.edu`.

The `ucsf-vpn details` queries the https://ipinfo.io/ service for
information on the current internet connection.

The `ucsf-vpn` software _neither_ collects nor stores your local or UCSF
credentials.


## Building from source

The self-contained `bin/ucsf-vpn` script is generated from
`src/ucsf-vpn.sh` and `src/incl/*.sh`. To rebuild `bin/ucsf-vpn`,
use:

```sh
$ make build
./build.sh
{{ BUILD_LOG }}
```
