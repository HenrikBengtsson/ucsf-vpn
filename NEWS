Version 3.2.0-9000 (2018-01-04)

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now 'ucsf vpn start --gui' gives more information about the steps
   taken and how to force or skip a UCSF notification popup, if such
   exists (which they add once in a while to notify users).

 o Now 'ucsf vpn start --gui' defaults to --no-notification, since
   UCSF has now removed the notification about the new 2FA requirements.


Version 3.2.0 (2017-12-14)

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now 'ucsf vpn start --gui' looks in the Pulse Secure GUI config file
   to identify which of several connections is for the target VPN URL.
   If none matches, a proper connection is automatically added to the
   settings.
   
 o Add option '--url <url>' for specifying the VPN URL.  Currently, only
   used for validation.

 o Now '--realm <realm>' is acknowledged also for --gui (though UCSF VPN
   still only 'Dual Factor Pulse Clients').

 o Now 'ucsf vpn troubleshoot' reports on the configured connections
   available in the Pulse Secure GUI.  If a connection to the UCSF-specific
   VPN URL is missing, then a warning is displayed.

 o Now 'ucsf-vpn start --gui' minimizes the main Pulse Secure GUI window

   should the Pulse Secure GUI or the CLI.

 o Added --token <token> to specify the one-time two-factor authentication
   (2FA) token, where '--token true' (default) will prompt user to enter
   token, and '--token false' will try to connect without 2FA.

   whether the USCF VPN login includes a "Pre Sign-In Notification" message
   that needs to be confirmed or not.

   submitting information to the GUI.

   (/usr/local/pulse/) of the Pulse Secure software and libraries.
