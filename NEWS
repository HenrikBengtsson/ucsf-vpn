ucsf-vpn
========

Version 3.0.0-9000 (2017-12-09)

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added support for '--token push' and '--token phone', which will
   authenticate via the Duo app (approve and confirm), and phone call
   ("press any key"), respectively.  Also, accepts '--token phone2',
   and '--token sms' but not sure the UCSF supports those.


Version 3.0.0 (2017-12-09)

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now supported by sending user credentials
   and 2FA tokens via the Pulse Secure GUI by utilizing xdotool (automated
   mouse clicks and key presses over X11).  It's not perfect, but it works.
 
 o Now 'ucsf-vpn start --gui' is the default.

 o 'ucsf-vpn start-gui' was renamed to 'ucsf-vpn open-gui'.

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now 'ucsf-vpn start' (with default --gui) connects to the UCSF VPN
   via the Pulse Secure GUI (by sending mouse and key sequences).

 o Added --gui (default) and --no-gui to control whether 'ucsf-vpn start'
   should the Pulse Secure GUI or the CLI.

 o Added --token <token> to specify the one-time two-factor authentication
   (2FA) token, where '--token true' (default) will prompt user to enter
   token, and '--token false' will try to connect without 2FA.

 o Added '--notification' (default) and '--no-notification' to indicate
   whether the USCF VPN login includes a "Pre Sign-In Notification" message
   that needs to be confirmed or not.
  
 o Added '--speed <factor>' for adjusting the waiting times between
   submitting information to the GUI.

 o Now 'ucsf-vpn troubleshoot' also reports on 'pulsesvc --version'.

 o Use environment variable PULSEPATH to override the default location
   (/usr/local/pulse/) of the Pulse Secure software and libraries.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

 o Credentials in ~/.ucsfvpnrc are defunct. Use ~/.netrc instead.

   where awk does not support POSIX regular expressions.

   adjust accordingly.  For instance, 'ucsf-vpn restart' will not
   try to infer public IP number if there is no internet connection
   but instead it will just go ahead an restart the local VPN service.
